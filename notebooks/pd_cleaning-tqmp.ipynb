    "# Introduction to Pandas -  Part 1: Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Long gone are the days of pen and paper research. Whether it is for data analysis, data cleaning or data manipulation, proficiency in digital tools has become an unavoidable skill to nurture and exploit. The social sciences are no exception. The reality for a vast number of researchers in psychology today still involves long hours of click-intensive, long and repetitive tasks in front of spreadsheets (*i.e.* Microsoft Excel) or similar statistical analysis software packages (*i.e.* IBM's SPSS). Further, any new iteration of the analysis consists of repeating the same steps and manipulations manually as if starting anew. This not only harms reproducibility (a foundational goal of scientific research and a documented pitfall in thr humanities), but also limits the capacity of research teams to develop an expertise in terms of reliable tools and processes that can be reused in different projects and passed on to new students or collaborators. Not to mention, the cumulative hours lost for graduate students performing menial tasks that could be better spent in more creative, cognitive tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, nowadays graduate students are increasingly encouraged to take on workshops or mini-courses of basic programming and it is not rare to find at least one proficient developer in research teams whose subject of study might very well be far from computer science. In such cases, the most popular choice of programming language is Python. With a very rich ecosystem of data science tools, Python is a general purpose language that allows to create automatized pipelines that can vary from faster, more reliable Excel-like operations, to automatized data gathering through web scraping or web APIs, perform statistical analysis, create beautiful, publication-ready plots, building advanced predictive models and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This post was orignially intended to be a simple analysis on the Bechdel test data (intro soon). However, by popular demand from friends and collegues who enjoyed my previous tutorials on matplotlib (LINKS!!!), I decided to release this parallel serires that would act as an introduction to pandas for all of you out there that are recently discovering this pillar of python data science or those who might not yet pandas good and want to learn to do other stuff good too. If you are already comfortable with pandas and/or are  interested only in the analysis, you can look at the original analysis at this link. (LINK!!)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the most inexperienced among us, what is Pandas? At its simplest, it is the sovereign data manipulation tool in your python data science toolbelt when you are dealing with data that fits nicely into a table format. If you have data in an excel file, csv, sql database, etc. and you are planning on cleaning it, exploring it, analyzing it or really do anything at all with it, you should immediately think of pandas (the bears first, then the library). Pandas makes it very easy to act on tabular data through their DataFrame (2D table, as in rows and columns) and Series (1D as in just a column) objects which come packed with fast and scalable functions to most tasks you might need to do. In this first post, I'll introduce some of these functions, with the goal of preparing a dataset for exploratory analysis. In later post, we will take this clean data and work on it also with pandas to derive and share new insights from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could praise pandas for days, but I better let it speak for itself. Before that, a quick intro to the data used in this tutorial. As a favor to a friend, we will all be looking at the [Bechdel test movie list].(https://bechdeltest.com/). The bechdel test, is a scoring system for movies popularized by a 1985 comic that gives a score of 1 if the movie has at least two named women in it (0 if it doesn't), a 2 if they talk to each other and a 3 if they talk together about something other than a man. It is a great dataset for practice, because it is easily accesible, the fact that anyone can contribute to it gives rise to good opportunities to practice cleaning and since it comes with an imdb-id column for the movies, we will be able to mix it with other movie datasets (with info on movie rating, budgets, etc) for new juicy insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a little less conversation and a little more action: we will start by importing the necessary libraries. For today, just pandas and pathlib's Path to help dealing with file paths:\n",

    "Nothing very fancy there. As before, we changed the delimiter to tabs ('\\t'), since that's how we saved it. Notice that we didn't need to explicitely tell it that the file was compressed... prety neat. We also had to specify the datatype of at least one column, the imdbid column. That is because pandas by default will try to infer the data type of ecach column. Since imdbid can be transformed into numbers, we would get a column of floats. That is problematic because any entry that starts with 0s would lose them. For example, the id for Pauvre Pierrot (entry 1) which has an imdbid of 0000003 would be converted to 3.0. That could be problematic since it doesn't accurately represent the true imdbid and would make cross-referecing harder (among other issues).\n",
